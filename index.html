<h2>
    Expectations From MANIT And MCA
</h2>
<P>
    After doing graduation in Mathematics, MCA is the best course which one should go for. Being
    from non-cs background, MCA opens the door for students like me and provides great job opportunities in the top IT companies in various roles .With this, I have keen interest in
    computer science so I can learn and develop skills which can help us to make our work easy and efficient . Being a part of MANIT family is an honour amd priviledge. My expectations are, to 
    get practical knowledge and exposure of the work environment in a highly competitve and professional world and get a better guidance and values from renowned faculty members of this institue.
</P>
